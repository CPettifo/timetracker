## timetracker

This app will track user activity in different projects, save user preferences as a .json file, and export the day's times as a new line in an excel spreadsheet, with the date and titles of the activities
Can store time temporarily in a .json file in case the user accidentally closes the program during the day, this file will be deleted when exporting to excel
Hotkeys cannot currently be changed

STATUS

Make an app with a UI - Functional, need to add a small window to display when user is recording time


To implement later:

-Timer pops up every 10 minutes

-Message or quote of the day, stored in a SQL database

-Allocate time to different projects/ manually edit when exporting
